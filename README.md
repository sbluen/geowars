A geometry wars type game written in Java.

Instructions for compiling and executing Space Invaders using Ant:
(These instructions assume that ant is already installed.)
<br/>1. Open the command prompt.
<br/>2. Change the working directory to the root directory.
<br/>3. Enter the command "ant".
<br/>4. Change the directory to "dist".
<br/>5. Enter into the command prompt "Space Invaders.jar".

A shortcut to simply run the game is to enter "ant main" instead of ant".
