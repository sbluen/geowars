A geometry wars type game written in Java.

Instructions for compiling and executing Space Invaders using Ant:
(These instructions assume that ant is already installed.)
1. Open the command prompt.
2. Change the working directory to the root directory.
3. Enter the command "ant".
4. Change the directory to "dist".
5. Enter into the command prompt "Space Invaders.jar".

A shortcut to simply run the game is to enter "ant main" instead of ant".
