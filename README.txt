Some facts about the game.

The maximum amount of enemies that can be on the screen at once time is 100.

So after a certain level, the amount of enemies wont increase so the difficulty is dependent only on the types of enemies that are created.

There is no last level and no way to officially win the game, the objective of the game is to get the highest possible score that you can before you die.

Powerups stay inbetween levels. It is a good strategy to save life powerups for when you need them.
We allowed this on purpose because we found it difficult for the user to stay alive if they couldnt save the life powerups between levels to increase their health.

Green mantis enemies are worth 20 points

Yellow are worth 25

The blue shooting enemies are worth 30 points

The green jellyfish enemies are worth 10

The score powerups (The dollar sign) is worth 50 points when touched

The life powerup is the spinning pink/purple thing that increments your life by 20

The player's maximum life is 100

The game will continue to play until you quit or until you die, there is no maximum level.

High scores are recorded when you save or when you die.
